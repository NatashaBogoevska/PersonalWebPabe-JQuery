            <h4>Why are small black holes more dangerous than big ones?</h4>
            <p>
                Why would someone falling into a stellar-mass black hole be spaghettified, but someone crossing the event horizon of a supermassive black hole would not feel much discomfort?
                First, what exactly causes spaghettification? This process is the result of tidal forces, or the difference in gravity between two points.
                As it turns out, there is a relatively simple equation that describes the tidal acceleration that a body of length d would feel, based on its distance from a given object with mass M: a = 2GMd/R3, where a is the tidal acceleration, G is the gravitational constant, and R is the body’s distance to the center of the object (with mass M).
                For a baseline, let’s calculate the tidal acceleration that an approximately 6-foot-tall (1.8 meters) person feels between their head and their feet while on the surface of Earth. Plugging in the numbers, it comes out to about 0.0000055 meter/second2. Now, how would tidal forces affect that same person falling into a stellar-mass black hole of 1 solar mass and an event horizon radius of 1.8 miles (2.9 kilometers), versus that same person falling into a supermassive black hole that is 100 million solar masses with an event horizon radius of 183 million miles (295 million km)?
                In the former case, the tidal acceleration is around 19.6 billion m/s2. And for the supermassive black hole, it’s only about 0.0000019 m/s2.
                So, for a person falling feet first into a stellar-mass black hole, the tidal forces stretch them out into a long, thin line resembling spaghetti. But when falling into a supermassive black hole, the tidal acceleration they feel is even smaller than what we experience on Earth!

            <h4>How To Travel In Switzerland Like A Pro</h4>
            <p>
                Planning a trip to Switzerland? A place to consider is St. Moritz.<br>
                St. Moritz is a luxury resort town in Switzerland’s alps! Besides some of the best ski and snowboarding slopes in the world (two winter olympics were held there)<br>
                St. Moritz has such a cute town with wooden houses, cozey cafes, a beautiful lake and a forest all around it. 
                A must do when you visit is going on a carriage ride through the forest under blankets, when my family and I did it,<br>
                I felt I was a princess in a Disney movie!<br>
                Even 5 years later I remember that night as through it were yesterday. 
                When we arrived we took the train from Zurich and it was the most scenic beautiful train ride I’ve ever been on.<br>
                The train tracks went through winding roads and forests and mountains and it allowed me to see so much of Switzerland before arriving to St Moritz.<br>
                Taking the train is also a cost efficient way to get there.
